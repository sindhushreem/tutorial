#A Tutorial on Node, React  and Grommet

**Node:**  
Node provide javascript runtime environment. Prior to Introduction of Node, javascript ran only in browsers. 
But, Now we can write javascript code and run with Node.

We need to install Node first in our machine. Node can be downloaded from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Check if Node is installed on your machine. ```node -v```

Once Node is installed, we can run javascript codes as:

```
node "filename.js"
```

**ECMAScript 6 (ES6):**

ES6 add some new syntax in existing javascript. I have highlighted some major changes in the Presentation.
Examples corresponding to each ES6 feature is shown in corresponding javascript file.

I have created sample app for React, Flux, Redux which can be found [here](https://github.com/zahid7292/react-examples)
